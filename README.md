# NZ News Website Comment section remover
Assuming you have AdBlockPlus installed (get it at https://adblockplus.org/), this will remove the comment sections for NZ news sites.

Currently, it only does Stuff.co.nz, NZ Herald and 3 News, but I can add more if you make suggestions (or if you make a pull request).

To add it, copy and paste the following into your browser address bar, then click the link:
